	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the prognostic value of apathy for mortality in patients of somatic (SC) and dementia special care (DSC) nursing home (NH) units., DESIGN: Longitudinal design, secondary analyses of a 2-year, cluster-randomized trial with six measurements, approximately 4 months in between., SETTING: SC and DSC-units of Dutch NHs., PARTICIPANTS: NH-patients of seventeen SC-units (n = 342) and sixteen DCS-units (n = 371)., MEASUREMENTS: Data were available for 713 NH-patients, 266 of whom died during the study. Apathy was assessed using the 10-item Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-10) and applied as categorical variable using known cut-off scores as well as dimensional variable. Additionally, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia., RESULTS: Mixed effects cox models using the coxme package in R revealed a higher risk of mortality between two measurements, if apathy was present (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.77; 95\% confidence interval (CI] = 1.35-2.31, P {\textless} .001). Results remained significant (HR = 1.64; 95\% CI = 1.23-2.19, P {\textless} .001) when controlled for depressive symptoms. DSC-units and SC-units did not differ (P {\textgreater} .05) in the effect of apathy on mortality. Male gender (HR = 1.67; 95\% CI = 1.23-2.27, P {\textless} .001), and higher age in years (HR = 1.06; 95\% CI = 1.04-1.08, P {\textless} .001) were also predictors of mortality. Regarding apathy as a dimensional construct, one standard deviation increase of AES-10 scores was associated with a 62\% increase of mortality risk (HR = 1.62, 95\% CI = 1.40-1.88, P {\textless} .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Apathy was associated with mortality over a 4-month period in NH patients, even when controlling for depression. These data suggest that screening and treatment strategies for apathy should be developed for this patient population.{\textcopyright} 2017, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2017, The American Geriatrics Society.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessment can be a powerful force in promoting student learning. Still, few measures exist to gauge Assessment for Learning (AFL) in the classroom. Literature on AFL suggests that it encompasses both a monitor to track student progress as well as a scaffold to show or help students recognize in what areas they need to improve. AIMS: Based on a review of recent attempts to measure the AFL, we constructed Assessment for Learning Questionnaires for Teachers (TAFL-Q) and for students (SAFL-Q) for evaluating perceptions regarding AFL practices in classrooms using matching items. SAMPLE: The total sample included 1,422 students (49\% girls, 51\% boys) and 237 teachers (43\% females, 57\% males) in lower vocational secondary education. METHODS: The 28-item questionnaires were examined by means of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using EQS on one random half of the sample. The CFA was cross-validated on the second half. Measurement invariance tests were conducted to compare the students and teacher versions of the questionnaires. RESULTS: CFA revealed a stable second-order two-factor structure that was cross-validated: perceived monitoring, and perceived scaffolding subsumed under a common factor: AFL. Tests for measurement invariance showed that the parallel constructs were measured similarly for both students and teachers. CONCLUSION: The TAFL-Q and SAFL-Q capture the construct AFL in two subscales: Monitoring and Scaffolding, and allows for comparisons between teacher and student perceptions. The instruments can be useful tools for teachers and students alike to identify and scrutinize assessment practices in classroom.},

Participants were 164 elementary school teachers who were randomly assigned to one of three CBM instructional approaches or a control condition. Instruction was delivered via videos. Prior to and after receiving instruction, teachers completed a CBM graph-comprehension task. They also evaluated the instructional videos. Teachers in the three instructional groups improved more in CBM graph comprehension than control teachers. Improvements were seen primarily in interpreting and linking the data to instruction, two important but difficult aspects of CBM graph comprehension. Differences between the instructional groups were found for interpreting the data. Teachers evaluated the videos positively. Results indicate that teachers{\textquoteright} CBM graph comprehension can be improved via video instruction. Implications for teaching teachers to implement CBM are discussed.},

	abstract = {To be able to effectuate the success of cooperative learning, it is important to understand students{\textquoteright} perceptions of specific cooperative learning activities. However, students{\textquoteright} perceptions of one and the same cooperative learning activity can vary to a large extent. To gain insight into student- and task- related sources of variability in students{\textquoteright} perceptions of a cooperative learning activity we examined if cognitive and social perspective- taking ability, instructional mode, and individual and group level-learning outcomes can predict primary-school students{\textquoteright} perceptions of relatively easy and more complex cooperative learning activities. The newly developed PCLA-Q was used to measure students{\textquoteright} perceptions of cooperative learning. Multilevel analyses revealed that social perspective-taking ability explains students{\textquoteright} perceptions of engagement in cooperative behaviors, but only when working on an easy task. Cognitive perspective-taking ability accounts for variability in students{\textquoteright} attitudes towards and perceived utility value of a complex task. Group learning outcomes, but not individual learning outcomes, can positively predict students{\textquoteright} attitudes towards and perceived utility value of both easy and complex tasks. Group learning outcomes also predict perceptions of engagement in cooperative behaviors while working on easy and complex tasks. We found no evidence that differences in the instructional mode affect students{\textquoteright} perceptions of a cooperative learning task. Hence, our findings suggest that students{\textquoteright} perceptions of a cooperative learning activity can vary between students and as a function of contextual variables, depending on students{\textquoteright} perspective-taking abilities, group learning outcomes, and the complexity of the task.},

This study was conducted to determine whether FoH assessed using the PHOSAACLR is a latent trait, and to analyze differences in PHOSA-ACLR in athletes with or without an ACL rupture. Methods: Three convenience samples completed the PHOSA-ACLR: (1) ACLR patients (n = 58; mean age 25.9 years; range 17{\textendash}56; SD = 8.2; 43\% male); (2) first year Physical Therapy (PT) students (n = 169; mean age = 19.2; SD = 2.0; 48\% male), and (3) junior football players (n = 30; mean age = 18.3; range 17{\textendash}20; SD = 3.2; 94\% males). ACLR patients additionally reported functioning and Fear of Movement. PHOSA-ACLR items were analyzed with Item Response Theory using the Graded Response Model (GRM). Differences between three groups of participants were analyzed using Univariate Analysis of Variance. Results: Data fitted the two-parameter GRM, and therefore the items of the PHOSA-ACLR constitute a latent trait. There was a significant difference between the three groups in PHOSA-ACLR after controlling for age and gender (F (2, 255) = 17.1, p {\textless} 0.001). PT students reported higher levels of FoH compared to either ACLR patients or healthy soccer players. Conclusion: PHOSA-ACLR items constitute a latent trait of FoH for ACLR-specific movements. Contrary to expectations, PHOSA-ACLR is higher in first year physiotherapy students compared to patients rehabilitating from ACLR, and healthy junior soccer players.},

	abstract = {This study investigates burnout among Dutch nursing graduates as a process by testing a sequential-developmental model. A sample of 237 respondents was recruited from a population of Dutch early career nurses. Burnout was measured with the Dutch version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS, Maslach \& Jackson, 1981; Schaufeli \& van Dierendonck, 2000). First, the dimensionality was tested with confirmatory factor analysis. A resulting one-dimensional model with exhaustion and depersonalisation was then analysed using a Rasch rating scale measurement model. Rasch analysis showed that these data adhered well to a sequential-developmental model. Burnout among early career nurses may be operationalized as a process that starts with fatigue as a result of strain and ends with severe exhaustion and depersonalisation towards patients. Personal accomplishment develops relatively independently. A separate Rasch analysis on the personal accomplishment items revealed a scale with almost similar item locations, resulting in redundant information.},
