Participants were 164 elementary school teachers who were randomly assigned to one of three CBM instructional approaches or a control condition. Instruction was delivered via videos. Prior to and after receiving instruction, teachers completed a CBM graph-comprehension task. They also evaluated the instructional videos. Teachers in the three instructional groups improved more in CBM graph comprehension than control teachers. Improvements were seen primarily in interpreting and linking the data to instruction, two important but difficult aspects of CBM graph comprehension. Differences between the instructional groups were found for interpreting the data. Teachers evaluated the videos positively. Results indicate that teachers' CBM graph comprehension can be improved via video instruction.

However, students{\textquoteright} perceptions of one and the same cooperative learning activity can vary to a large extent. To gain insight into student- and taskrelated sources of variability in students{\textquoteright} perceptions of a cooperative learning activity we examined if cognitive and social perspectivetaking ability, instructional mode, and individual and group level-learning outcomes an predict primary-school students{\textquoteright} perceptions of relatively easy and more complex cooperative learning activities. The newly developed PCLA-Q was used to measure students{\textquoteright} perceptions of cooperative learning. Multilevel analyses revealed that social perspective-taking ability explains students{\textquoteright} perceptions of engagement in cooperative behaviors, but only when working on an easy task. Cognitive perspective-taking ability accounts for variability in students{\textquoteright} attitudes towards and perceived utility value of a complex task. Group learning outcomes, but not individual learning outcomes, can positively predict students{\textquoteright} attitudes towards and perceived utility value of both easy and complex tasks. Group learning outcomes also predict perceptions of engagement in cooperative behaviors while working on easy and complex tasks. We found no evidence that differences in the instructional mode affect students{\textquoteright} perceptions of a cooperative learning task.

Thirty college/university students completed a two-part study in which they viewed various slope-to-goal and slope-to-slope patterns of CBM-graphed data and answered decision-making questions.

First, the dimensionality was tested with confirmatory factor analysis. A resulting one-dimensional model with exhaustion and depersonalisation was then analysed using a Rasch rating scale measurement model. Rasch analysis showed that these data adhered well to a sequential-developmental model. Burnout among early career nurses may be operationalized as a process that starts with fatigue as a result of strain and ends with severe exhaustion and depersonalisation towards patients.

Assessment can be a powerful force in promoting student learning. Still, few measures exist to gauge Assessment for Learning (AFL) in the classroom. Literature on AFL suggests that it encompasses both a monitor to track student progress as well as a scaffold to show or help students recognize in what areas they need to improve.Aims. Based on a review of recent attempts to measure the AFL, we constructed Assessment for Learning Questionnaires for Teachers (TAFL‐Q) and for students (SAFL‐Q) for evaluating perceptions regarding AFL practices in classrooms using matching items.Sample. The total sample included 1,422 students (49% girls, 51% boys) and 237 teachers (43% females, 57% males) in lower vocational secondary education.Methods. The 28‐item questionnaires were examined by means of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using EQS on one random half of the sample. The CFA was cross‐validated on the second half. Measurement invariance tests were conducted to compare the students and teacher versions of the questionnaires.Results. CFA revealed a stable second‐order two‐factor structure that was cross‐validated: perceived monitoring, and perceived scaffolding subsumed under a common factor: AFL. Tests for measurement invariance showed that the parallel constructs were measured similarly for both students and teachers.Conclusion. The TAFL‐Q and SAFL‐Q capture the construct AFL in two subscales: Monitoring and Scaffolding, and allows for comparisons between teacher and student perceptions. The instruments can be useful tools for teachers and students alike to identify and scrutinize assessment practices in classroom.",  author    = "{Pat El}, R.J. and Harm Tillema and Mien Segers and Paul Vedder",  year      = "2013",  month     = mar,  doi       = "10.1111/j.2044-8279.2011.02057.x",  language  = "English",  volume    = "83",  pages     = "98--113",  journal   = "British Journal of Educational Psychology",  issn      = "1476-9808",  publisher = "The British Psychological Society",  number    = "1", }

Interpersonal teacher behavior and student motivational needs are used to explain the effects of assessment for learning on intrinsic motivation by comparing students from different ethnic backgrounds. The final study's sample consisted of 558 students from Dutch secondary vocational education. Multi-level structural equation modeling was used to test possible models. Our findings show that modes of feedback (monitoring, scaffolding) and teacher interpersonal behavior are strongly related to predictors of student motivation. In line with self-determination theory, our findings indicated that competence and relatedness mediate the effect of feedback (both monitoring and scaffolding) on motivation. Multi-group analyses showed only small differences for ethnicity, especially in relation to mode of feedback, which led us to conclude that, irrespective of the “Immigrant Paradox”, assessment for learning may facilitate feedback provision for both immigrant and native Dutch students indiscriminately, thereby enhancing motivation to learn. Implications of these findings for learning in classrooms are discussed.",  keywords  = "Feedback, Intrinsic motivation, Assessment for learning, Interpersonal behavior, Ethnicity, Self-determination theory",  author    = "RJ Pat-El and H.

@inproceedings{f8a6e9ab271e4abea0d82c1339fea3de,  title     = "Validation of a (peer) feedback perceptions questionnaire",  abstract  = "A core educational goal is to produce self-directed lifelong learners who have acquired or are able to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for their future professional workplace in a networked world. Constructivist and socio-constructivist theories of learning and instruction recommend using collaborative learning scenarios in all kinds of educational contexts in order to attain this goal. Thus, (networked) collaborative learning receives increasing attention in Higher and Further Education. To empower students as self-regulated and collaborative learners peer assessment and peer feedback areincreasingly applied in both networked and face-to-face collaborative learning environments. Thus, the conditions under which peer feedback is beneficial for students{\textquoteright} learning are worth to be investigated in detail. While the efficiency of feedback content has received much attention in prior feedback research, students{\textquoteright} feedback perceptions have been hardly studied. In addition, students{\textquoteright}emotional state can mediate the impact of (peer) feedback on their performance. Yet, each kind of feedback has to be perceived and processed in a mindful way, that is, attended to, understood and interpreted, and finally transformed into a corrective action by the student before it can influence subsequent learning. Since up to now the issue of feedback perception has been a neglected area offeedback research, instruments for measuring feedback perceptions are lacking. The purpose of this paper is thus to describe the development and the structural validation of a feedback perception questionnaire which measures students{\textquoteright} feedback perceptions in terms of fairness (FA), usefulness (US), acceptance (AC), willingness to improve (WI) and affect (AF). The sample consists of 1535secondary education students. They received a scenario in which a fictional student received fictional peer feedback on a writing assignment and this feedback was Concise General (CGF) or Elaborated Specific (ESF). The students{\textquoteright} were asked to rate their perception of the feedback as if they had received the feedback themselves. The analyses confirm the structural validity of the five scales. FA, US and AC constitute the joined second order component {\textquoteleft}Perceived Adequacy of Feedback{\textquoteright} (PAF), which in turn positively predicts willingness to improve (WI) and affect (AF). The scale reliabilities were good to excellent. ",  author    = "JW Strijbos and RJ Pat-El and S.
