## my to-do list based on online advice

https://theprofessorisin.com/2016/08/19/dr-karens-rules-of-the-academic-cv/


I'm considering adding a 'roadmap' to associate professor, based on the admission criteria of my university, and how far I am in meeting them:

Criterium                                          |	done?      |
:--------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|
UD1	                                             | ja          |
promovendi                                         | ja          |
AiO-subsidie                                       | ja          |
één publicatie per jaar (first/second/last author) | ja          |
management	                                       | ja          |
promovendi klaar                                   | nee         |
promovendi publicaties                             | nee         |
twee publicaties per jaar, 50% first/second/last   | nee         |
totaal minimaal 20 publicaties                     | nee         |
Erkende internationale expertise*                  | nee         |


## move publications to their own page with yearly timeline?

I'm thinking of moving my list of publications to their own page. There it might be easier to have a clear seperation of publications per year.
E.g: https://codepen.io/mathiesjanssen/pen/ggeBKm


II.  Content:

1. Education. *done*

2. Professional Appointments/Employment. *done*

3. Publications. Subheadings: 
   - *Books* 
   - *Edited Volumes* 
   - Refereed Journal Articles
   - Book Chapters
   - Conference Proceedings
   - *Encyclopedia Entries*
   - *Book Reviews*
   - **Manuscripts in Submission (give journal title)**
   - **Manuscripts in Preparation, Web-Based Publications**
   - Other Publications (this section can include non-academic publications, within reason).  

4. Awards and Honors. *done*

5. Grants and Fellowships *done*

6. Invited Talks. These are talks to which you have been invited at OTHER campuses, not your own. Give title, institutional location, and date. Year only (not month or day) at left.  Month and day of talk go into entries.

7. Conference Activity/Participation. 
Subheadings: 
    - Panels Organized. 
    - Papers Presented. 
    - Discussant

7a.  Campus or Departmental Talks.  These are talks that you were asked to give in your own department or on your own campus. These do not rise to the level of an “Invited Talk” but still may be featured under the heading of Campus Talks or Departmental Talks.  List as you would Invited Talks.  Under no circumstances may guest lectures in courses be listed here or anywhere on the CV. That is padding.

8. Teaching Experience. Subdivide either by area/field of teaching or by institutional location, or by Graduate/Undergraduate, or some combination of these as appropriate to your particular case. 
Subheadings:
    - Leiden University
        - course 1 (terms and years)
        - course 2
        - ...
    - Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
    - Open Universiteit

If your quantity of courses taught exceeds approximately 15, condense this section; it is not essential for a highly experience teacher to scrupulously list every single course taught, every single time.  Just cover your general range of competencies.

TA experience goes here.  No narrative verbiage under any course title. No listing of “duties” or “responsibilities.”  There is one small exception to this rule, as noted in the comment stream (near comment #100).  If your department is one that has its “TAs” actually design and sole-teach courses, then this needs to be clarified.  Language to be added can include, “(Instructor of record)” after course title, or “(As TA I designed and sole-taught all courses listed here),” etc.  Keep it short and sweet.

9.  Research Experience. RA experience goes here, as well as lab experience.  This is one location where slight elaboration is possible, if the research was a team effort on a complex, multi-year theme.  One detailed sentence should suffice.  

10. Service To Profession. Include journal manuscript review work (with journal titles [mss. review CAN be given its own separate heading if you do a lot of this work]), leadership of professional organizations, etc. Some people put panel organizing under service; check conventions in your field.

11. Departmental/University Service. Include search committees and other committee work, appointments to Faculty Senate, etc.  Sorry to be a pain, but here the convention is that the Title or Committee is left justified, with the year in the entry.  Don’t ask me why, and only a convention, not a strict rule.

13. Community Involvement/Outreach. [Optional.]  This includes work with libraries and schools, public lectures, etc.

15.  Related Professional Skills. [Optional.] Can include training in GIS and other technical skills relevant to the discipline. More common in professional schools and science fields; uncommon in humanities.

16. Non-Academic Work. [Optional—VERY optional!] Include only if relevant to your overall academic qualifications. More common in Business, sciences. Editorial and publishing work possibly relevant in English and the Humanities.  

18. Languages. All languages to be listed vertically, with proficiency in reading, speaking, and writing clearly demarcated using terms such as: native, fluent, excellent, conversational, good, can read with dictionary, etc.

19. Professional Memberships/Affiliations. All professional organizations of which you are a member listed vertically. Include years of joining when you are more senior and those years recede into the past—demonstrates length of commitment to a field.

20. References. List references vertically. Give name and full title. Do not refer to references as “Dr. xxx,” or “Professor xxx.” This makes you look like a graduate student. Give full snail mail contact information along with tel and email. To do otherwise is amateurish, even though we know nobody is going to use the snail mail address. Do not give narrative verbiage or explanation of these references (ie, “Ph.D. Committee member,” etc.). The only exception is a single reference that may be identified as “Teaching Reference.” This would be the fourth of four references.
